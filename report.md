# Stock Analysis Report: AAPL

## 1. Introduction and Overview
This report presents an analysis of stock data for the ticker symbol **AAPL** from **2020-01-01** to **2021-01-01**. It covers data loading, visualization, deep learning forecasts, and forecast evaluation metrics.

## 2. Definitions and Explanations
### 2.1 Basic Stock Metrics
- **Close Price**: The final trading price of the stock for the day. This value is critical for gauging market sentiment at the end of trading sessions.
- **Volume**: The total number of shares traded during a given period. High volume often signals increased market interest or volatility.

### 2.2 Time Series and Statistical Analysis
- **Volatility**: A measure of how much the stock price fluctuates over time, calculated over intervals such as 30-day and 90-day periods.
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: A process that splits a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand underlying patterns.
- **Dickey-Fuller Test**: A statistical test used to determine if a time series is stationary, which is a necessary condition for many forecasting models.

### 2.3 Technical Indicators
- **Moving Averages**: Techniques that smooth out short-term fluctuations to reveal longer-term trends. Common periods include 30, 90, 120, and 365 days.
- **Dividend Yield**: The ratio of a companyï¿½s annual dividend relative to its share price, used to assess the income potential of an investment.

### 2.4 Forecasting Models and Evaluation Metrics
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network that captures long-term dependencies, used here to forecast closing prices.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A streamlined version of LSTM with fewer parameters, offering similar forecasting capabilities with improved computational efficiency.
- **Theil's U Statistic**: A metric that compares the performance of the forecast model to a naive forecast. Lower values indicate better performance.
- **Naive Forecast**: A baseline forecasting method that simply carries forward the last observed value as the future prediction.
- **Cross-Validation**: A method to assess model generalizability by partitioning data into training and validation sets.
- **Backtesting**: The process of evaluating a forecasting model using historical data to simulate its performance in real-world scenarios.

## 3. Data Loading and Preparation
The dataset was obtained from Yahoo Finance for the ticker symbol **AAPL** between **2020-01-01** and **2021-01-01**. Missing values were filled using interpolation to create a continuous time series for analysis.
